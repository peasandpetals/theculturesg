== Description ==
The plugin registers a configurable shortcode that allows you to create a dynamic content selection from your posts, pages and custom post types by combining and filtering what you need. The shortcode can be generated very easy, the plugin will add a shortcode button for this in the editor area.

== Changelog ==
= 6.3 = 
* Tested up to 4.5.2
* Fix parents list
* Replace thickbox style

= 6.2 = 
* Add support for post status filter
* Add support for exclude tags by slugs. The new argument sample: exclude_tags="slug1,slug2" 

= 6.1 = 
* Add suppress filters false
* Apply filters before displaying the post image

= 6.0 = 
* Add support for the Latest Post Shortcode Slider extension

= 5.4 =
* Add the plugin link
* Separate the content and excerpt filters
* Tested up to 4.3.1

= 5.3 =
* Add the 'open in a new window' option for the links

= 5.2 =
* Implement changes to render full posts content (including the extra shortcodes)

= 5.1 =
* Add the order option (by date, title, menu order)
* Add the ajax pagination option. As the shortcode pagination relies on the wp native pagination, when using more shortcodes with pagination on the same page, the navigation will affect all shortcodes, hence, by activating the ajax pagination, each shortcode pagination will act independent

= 5.0 =
* Add the extra display of post tags of the posts
* Add filter to allow the text widget to render the content of a shortcode

= 4.2 =
* Introduce the post date in the output. The general settings will apply to the date and time format.

= 4.1 =
* Add changes to the javascript to avoid the content check for resize when lightbox resources are not available (compatibility with other plugins)

= 4.0 =
* Add Pagination Position (default to top only) so that the pagination can be displayed below the results, or above and below the results
* Add Dynamic Tag option so that you can show the posts that have one of the current page tags (current page is the page where the shortcode is embedded), without the need to specify a particular tag. This is useful to display something like "similar posts" or "on the same topic", etc.

= 3.1 =
* Populate the "Use Image" dropdown dynamically from the list of image sizes registered in the application
* Add global tile a class to differentiate when the link is applied to the entire tile content or to just the "read more" text

= 3.0 =
* Add No Pagination / Paginate Results option that allows to paginate the posts selection
* Add Records Per Page option
* Add Offset
* Add Hide / Show Pagination Navigation that allows to hide or show the pagination
* Reload Tile Pattern selection when a shortcode is selected before clicking the plugin button (reload shotcode settings in the content selection lightbox) 

= 2.0 =
* Allow for different tile pattern (the html tags order in the tile: post title, image, text and read more message) 
* Add visual tile pattern selector
* Add short excerpt and short content options
* Add chars limit to the excerpt or content for the tile
* Add custom "read more" message option
* Allow for the post link to wrap the entire tile or just the "read more" message if this is set

== Upgrade Notice ==
