		<div class="entry-content">
			<p>It is common for AQ to ask you to contextualize the issues to Singapore&#8217;s society. As such, there is a need for you to be familiar with certain features in Singapore. Listed below are just some features for you to brainstorm. They are not exhaustive.</p>
<p><strong>Singaporean&#8217;s behaviour (positive)</strong>: Hardworking, ambitious, have high expectations, obedient, law-abiding, willing to upgrade skills and take pay cut, non-violent.</p>
<p><strong>Singaporean&#8217;s behaviour (negative)</strong>: Kiasu, elitist, materialistic, overly pragmatic, non-gracious, self-centered/selfish, overly competitive, not innovative, conservative and afraid of changes.</p>
<p>*Behaviour generally tends to be tolerant of new trends rather than accepting (esp LGBT).</p>
<p><strong>Political culture</strong>: Conservative, but generally opening up to more opposition voices and increased numbers of opposition in parliament. Dual-party system in the near future? A more educated populace that is more vocal and critical towards the ruling party PAP. Party whip to organize and keep the party in check. Party likes to use carrot and stick approach to control the populace, but this approach could be increasingly irrelevant as the population becomes richer and more critical to be swayed so easily. Common issues at present: rising housing prices, increasing foreigners, transport and lack of places in university for the locals.</p>
<p><strong>Education culture</strong>: Kiasu; a highly vibrant tuition industry (seen to be a necessity to supplement skills and teaching rather than for weaker students only); heavy emphasis of academic results. Society is moving towards a more broad-based education through SOTA, Sports school etc. Government&#8217;s emphasis on the multiple paths to success, and increasing emphasis on liberal arts education as seen in Yale-NUS. Education system still largely driven by exams/assessment, but measures have been put in place to reduce this exam stress. Primary 1 and 2 students no longer have examinations.</p>
<p><strong>Media/Arts culture</strong>: High censorship. Presence of the OB markers. Diminishing traditional arts and local culture. Increasing home grown arts culture as seen through movies and theatre plays. Most of the art influence is largely global currently. Singapore aims to be part of the Renaissance City. Freedom of speech on the media is one of the lowest in the world. Media is a vehicle of the PAP, could be used as a propaganda vehicle for them.</p>
<p><strong>Science and Technology: </strong>Research in S&amp;T and focus on biotechnology is the key pillar of the Singapore&#8217;s economy. Strong emphasis on the info-communication research here, IDA. Aims to be a smart nation. Presence of ethical regulatory bodies in research such as the Bioethics Advisory Committee.</p>
<p><strong>Society: </strong>Pragmatic and highly focused on the Singapore&#8217;s Dream. Focus on the &#8216;5Cs&#8217;. Multi-racial; multi-lingual; multi-religious society. Tension between an economically progressive society vs an all inclusive society. Increasing income inequality in Singapore, though there are &#8220;social safety nets&#8221; to ensure that no one is being left behind. Materialistic culture has bred a generation of politically apathetic youths, but there is increasing number of youths who are socially aware and responsible, seen in community outreach programs. Young society that is still grappling how to define her identity.</p>
<p><strong>Economics: </strong>Focus on FDI in the past, now trying to focus on growing the local industry. Focus on entrepreneurship, especially since now the economy is getting more and more volatile and complex. There is a need to learn soft skills, cater to the economy and create a job for yourself. Very open market that is highly reliant on trade and economic fluctuations overseas. Seen to be an economic miracle with no natural resources yet being able to transform itself into a first world economy.</p>
<p>These are just some main characteristics of Singapore. You would need to know how to apply them in your AQ. Knowing them is not enough. Please also apply the modern day characteristics to your AQ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Question analysis:</p>
<p>At the expense: at the cost of something, the opportunity cost. Please note that you have to address this criteria throughout the whole essay.</p>
<p>Ethical: Relating to moral principles. Pls note that ethics are subjective and every individual has different moral codes. What is considered ethical to an individual may not be to another.</p>
<p><strong>Yes business should be ethical: </strong></p>
<p>Businesses especially large multi-national corporations (MNCs) today are the bedrock of many capitalistic societies, hence they should be ethical in their practices in order to set the moral tone of how business is done in the corporate world, and to a larger extent, the societal values. Businesses will suffer from a lack of trust and reputation especially if they have flouted some ethical considerations. E.g. H&amp;M have been facing lawsuits in Europe for their sweatshops conditions and exploitation of child labour to manufacture their cheap and affordable clothing. It is highly likely that businesses will suffer from fines and increased regulations if they are seen to be unethical in their business practices. This could affect the company profits drastically and potential sales, which will impact on the eventual staff welfare and salaries that they draw. A case in point would be Volkswagen which was found to have cheated on their diesel emission, and being fined $14.7 billion for it.</p>
<p>It is unlikely for an unethical business to be a champion of staff welfare. Ethics is what make up an organization and if the corporate culture is one that is unethical, it is highly unlikely that bosses will appreciate and care for the staff that makes the business possible in the first way. It is possibly very results-orientated and a cut throat corporate culture where competition is valued first. During difficult times, companies are likely to fire and retrench staff, withhold their benefits without any consideration to protect these staff&#8217;s families. After all, the company and the need to stay afloat comes first. E.g. SPH recently pledges to retrench 10% of their staff in order to keep company profits afloat, rather than thinking of how to generate more revenue through other arms of operations and keeping these staff.</p>
<p><strong>Business should be unethical: </strong></p>
<p>There is a need to find the most cost efficient method of production in order to stay afloat in this cut throat business world. Businesses in this case, are not unethical by choice, rather it is by the push of society and the consumers to be unethical, especially when consumers refuse to pay more for the products. Fast fashion industry is very competitive and companies have to resort to overseas factories and even child labour to manufacture clothes as cheaply as possible to cater to a larger group of consumers. It is not practical for all businesses to venture into serving the luxury group, since there is only that many number of consumers who can afford to pay. Sometimes being unethical comes at the expense of the company&#8217;s ability to protect their own staff who have slogged hard for them and to return their loyalty. Employees&#8217; livelihood should be considered before ethics and perhaps ethics should be decided and regulated more often by the authorities on what constitutes proper business practices.</p>
<p>Finally, ethical standards differ throughout the world. Every individual has different expectations with regards to their working hours, treatment and pay scheme. What is deemed unethical to a person in a developed place (e.g. working for less than $5/hr here could be seen as a blessing to someone in the developing countries). Resorting to unethical means is only a short term measure for businesses, as once reputation is tarnished, it takes forever to build it back up again.</p>
<p>P.s Pls note that this is just a sample outline for a business and money essay question. Further points will be elaborated in our lessons.</p>

			<p>Now that the A levels GP paper is drawing nearer and nearer, many students have asked about their revision strategies&#8230;</p>
<p>Given the limited time left, I would advise students to :</p>
<ol>
<li>Consolidate their niche chosen topics for the exam- in terms of the arguments, content, evaluation and examples.</li>
<li>Make a list of the past mistakes that you have committed in your GP exams- it could range from very simple problems of hijacking the question, to overgeneralization. Commit it to memory and not repeat it again. Revise and take note of your weaknesses.</li>
<li>Take note of some of the exemplar essays that your school or tutor has given you. What are the features of these exemplar essays? Remember to include them in your essay.</li>
<li>The rest would lie on you and your question choice on that day of the exams. I have always told my students that the question choice is the most important, followed by the topics that they have prepared. There is no point doing a question even if u know the content but do not know how to tweak it to the question requirement. You will never see a quality grade.</li>
</ol>
<p>That&#8217;s all for now, and good luck everyone!</p>

			<p><strong>Question Type: </strong>Simple Polarity (no conditional words present in the question)<br />
<strong>Key Words:</strong> The young; drive<br />
<strong>Minimum Requirements:</strong> Students will need to unpack the key words and explore the reasons why one can argue that the young lack drive. Similarly, they must be able to also highlight why some may disagree with this claim. Better scripts will look to evaluate the arguments based on the changes that have occurred in today’s world and provide a broad and varied range of examples, not just limited to Singapore.</p>
<p>P: <strong>The young of today are soft, pampered and dependent because comfortable lives they enjoy today do not provide any impetus to strive.</strong><br />
E: The young live in a world have enjoyed the peace, prosperity, affluence, tranquillity and comfort brought by the 80s and the 90s. With greater affluence and smaller families, they are unlike earlier generations who are forced by dire circumstances to work very hard to feed their families or for survival. This lack of urgency or hunger driven by need allows them to take things easy.<br />
Eg: In many societies worldwide, across both western and eastern cultures, in both First World countries like the USA, the EU and Japan as well as the newly developed economies of Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia, young people normally come from one-child or two-child families where the young is being molly-coddled and spoiled. Over-indulgent parents pamper these children so much that they have no initiative and cannot do simple things like washing their own cups after drinking or carrying their own schoolbag while in Primary School.L: These young people will necessarily grow up to have no initiative and sense of urgency as everything has been done for them. With their parents carrying the full financial burden of the family, they see no need to be very independent and give up easily when things go wrong.</p>
<p>P: <strong> With greater affluence and family support, young people can afford to pursue their passions and try new things </strong><br />
E: Coming from smaller and more affluent families, young people are no longer pressed by necessity to submit to mundane jobs right after graduation and have the option to pursue their passions. While some may be hindered by fear of failure, there is now a choice to pursue something driven by desire rather than necessity for others.E: This is evident in young people who give up stable jobs to pursue their dreams such as setting up their own businesses.</p>
<p>P: <strong>They are risk-averse and are not willing to step out of their comfort zones.</strong><br />
E: In today’s competitive world, failure is a very expensive proposition. As such, in many societies, there is a fear of risk-taking and failing. Unsurprisingly, this has also affected the young who grow up in an education system that is consistently ranking and assessing them against benchmarks and model answers. Therefore, they lack the drive to venture out of their comfort zones and try new things in life, preferring to ‘play it safe’. As a result, many find themselves lacking the energy to get out of mundane jobs, leading routine lives.<br />
Eg: For example, one common trait in Singapore is the lack of young Singaporeans who are willing to become entrepreneurs. Many are content to get themselves an education and work for others.</p>
<p>P: <strong>They look for instant rewards and are not willing to work hard long term to achieve their hopes and aspirations.</strong><br />
E: They are impatient because they never had to wait for anything as everything was instantly given, especially in the fast-pace society today where businesses compete with each other to offer the most immediate and convenient solutions to their consumers. With ‘same-day deliveries’ and ‘express results’, young people are used to instant gratification and lack the determination to persevere if things do not yield instant results.E: Young people have a tendency to quit their jobs very quickly because they do not feel fulfilled in them, choosing to find an easier or better option rather than staying and making what they have work.</p>
<p>p.s: this essay is contributed with most of the points from an ex student. Points are taken from his school magazine. This essay serves as a reference point only.</p>

			<p>This question assumes that as the world gets more and more globalized, there is greater freedom of movement of ideas, trades and people, so much so that our lives are intertwined.  The increasing globalization of the world is also made more astute with the pervasiveness of social media. As such, it makes little sense for us to have physical or economic boundaries anymore. To do well for this question, students need to compare to the past to assess whether recent trends render national boundaries/territories irrelevant.</p>
<p><strong>Why they make little sense nowadays? </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Globalization is a phenomenon that we cannot avoid, to remain economically isolated would be to the peril of the economic health of the nation. Most countries today are open economies that engage in free trade to boost their exports. Being plugged into the world economy also means greater markets to sell their goods to, enabling them to earn more money and attain economic growth to improve the citizens&#8217; standard of living. It is unrealistic and impractical to expect countries to be self sufficient in the manufacturing of most goods and services in the modern age. Examples of closed economies include North Korea and Brazil which point towards low growth and bleak standard of living for their citizens. Comparatively, countries that engage in trade like Singapore and Hong Kong have relatively higher standard of living and growth for their citizens. However, one should note that being engaged in the world economy comes at its costs too. Income inequality is definitely one problem that the government has to tackle. But I guess it is a lesser of the two evils (income inequality and poverty) that governments would rather deal with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rise of regional and international organizations to foster international cooperation to resolve cross border problems such as environmental and territorial issues, render national boundaries to have little relevance. Many of the world issues plaguing us today are cross-borders such as terrorism, trade in weapons, haze etc. Examples of regional organizations include ASEAN to resolve cross border issues such as the South China Sea and even the Indonesia haze problem. These issues are brought up to the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) where member countries can debate about them and see how best to resolve them. Also, the UN has been pretty proactive in trying to resolve cross border smuggling and trading of weapons, especially in tacking state sponsored terrorism. These issues have wide-scale impact that could not be resolved just by nations, rather it requires the involvement of many parties.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Why they still have relevance? </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>National boundaries are important to prevent cross borders problems such as illegal immigrants, smuggling of arms and drugs. It allows governments to monitor these illegal activities in their states properly and to act on them to remove these threats. Thailand and Malaysia have been in conflict for illegal migrants crossing each other territories and affecting the safety and security of the place. Also, Malaysia has been accused of sponsoring insurgencies movements in Thailand for the Thai Muslims and selling arms. With proper boundaries, Thailand would be able to demarcate the zones and nip the problem quickly and deport these illegal migrants and insurgents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Economic boundaries make sense as a way of insulating the country from too much uncertainties from the outside economic environment. An example could be UK voting out of Brexit recently, due to migrants issue and funding of the EU especially for the less productive countries. In such cases, boundaries do make some sense, especially if countries want to make a clear stand about safeguarding their economy and their citizens and not providing for the economically less productive countries.</p>
</li>
</ol>

			<p>Getting what one wants in life is what matters. Discuss.</p>
<p>This is a very deep philosophical question that requires students to answer in a mature way on what do they think life is about. What are the things that matter to us? Do they hold any meaning at all at the end? Is it even possible for us to get what we want, if at all?</p>
<p>First, let&#8217;s define what are the things that matter to us in life. To most of us, some of the tangible and intangible things that we have been pursuing sure hold some weight: Money, status, power, love, relationships with friends and family, good health, career goal, collecting of a myriad of life experiences etc. Though these things do matter in some way or another, do the attainment of these make us less contented and fulfilled over time? Will the initial satisfaction of attaining these goals be waned off?</p>
<p>What exactly is important in life? Is it the attainment of what matters or the pursuit of these goals that give us a sense of fulfillment, life purpose and satisfaction? For me, I think what I&#8217;m after is more of the pursuit and the challenge of attaining the goals, than the goals themselves. The thrill of the chase is definitely what keeps many ambitious and driven individuals going, with a focus and a sight of the goal in mind. The prospect of getting the goal one fine day is what keeps individuals going and giving them a sense of hope. We do not necessarily need to get our goals, it is alright to fall short of them. After all, with a bit of failure that we get to appreciate some of our success. That is the paradox of life itself.</p>
<p>Of course, others will argue and think that there is no point in the continuous chase if the goal is always unattainable. What we want ultimately is the goal in itself. But then, what&#8217;s the point of possessing the goal/item since we have to lose them anyways? Nothing in life is permanent and we cannot continuously hold on to them anyway right? 🙂</p>
<p>P.s This post is not meant to be written in the full essay structure outline. Is just meant to get you thinking more about life, and what exactly is meaning to each and every single one of us. Is the attainment and our obsession with goals so important at the end of the day?</p>

			<p>Traditions are important because it provides people with a way to govern themselves in a world where moral standards are now often being compromised. Most traditions have moral and ethical messages embedded within them, and these serve as guidelines as to how people should govern themselves and, therefore, gain a degree of control over their lives. Before the invention of today&#8217;s modern laws, people used traditions as their guiding principles and while some traditions were abandoned, most of them are recycled and reused as the basis or foundations for some of the existing laws today. At times, traditions could have such a powerful and pervading influence, so much so that they become unspoken laws, laws of logic that the masses hold to. Examples of traditions that we hold dear would be the Chinese New Year festival, where it teaches the value of sharing and family unity and importance.</p>
<p>Traditions are also important to keep us rooted in our own self identity especially in this globalized world where the spread of Americanization serves to dilute our own culture and values. The unique practices that people still and continually adhere to, serve as a reminder of our origins and give us a glimpse into the lives of our ancestors. It is only through undergoing the activities that our ancestors have undergone, that we are able to understand our personal histories and be aware of the cultural identities that we each possess, particularly, in Singapore where it also serves as a binding force for a heterogeneous society, where a plethora of different cultures and traditions abound.</p>
<p>However, retaining a sense of tradition may not be important as it may lead to segregation and divide people especially in a multi-racial and multi-religious country such as Singapore. While having a sense of tradition unites people together, it only applies to people who belong to a particular group who share the same traditions. This inadvertently creates an &#8220;us&#8221; versus &#8220;them&#8221; kind of mind set within the different parties and it would serve to heighten the sense of suspicion and fear. Also, given that Singapore is increasingly globalized and greater influx of people are coming to this city to work and travel, it does not make sense to retain traditions. Traditions in this case no longer serve any purpose and they should be re-adapted to fit the contexts of the present day.</p>
<p>Finally, traditions may not even hold any role in today&#8217;s world where people&#8217;s lives are getting more and more fast-paced- simply because people do not have the time to uphold these traditions. For example, it has been observed that the annual Chinese Qing Ming festival is in the danger of being virtually extinct. The number of families that turn up on the day of Qing Ming has been decreasing most likely because of tight and busy working schedules which incidentally, has been cited as one of the common reasons by Singaporean Chinese. In a world where stress is placed on individuals to succeed and to attain a degree of sustainable income to support themselves, such traditions serve to hinder their progress and may make them lose out on the race, therefore, traditions may not always be important.</p>

			<p>Nuclear research, despite its usefulness in benefitting the populace, can also be used as a form of weaponry to destroy, with catastrophic results. Nuclear technology is extremely harmful in its natural form, even if stored within a power plant. Its destructive potential, when fully unleashed, makes it an excellent choice as a missile or a bomb. These nuclear weapons can be used to cause extreme devastation, obliterating entire cities, leaving behind millions of scars and gargantuan mushroom clouds in its wake, as can be testified by victims and survivors of the Hiroshima atomic bombing by the US, which left a decades-long curse on the physical health of the people and their descendants, as well as the land and air conditions in the area.  In fact, during the cold war, the world was very close to a nuclear meltdown best seen in the Cuban Missile Crisis. Nuclear technology has already been misused and abused for decades, which goes to show that the world is not mature enough to handle nuclear research. If left in the wrong hands, it can yield highly disastrous and cataclysmic results, even if it is for a &#8220;just cause&#8221;.</p>
<p>Nuclear technology, if not being deliberately used for genocide purposes, can also be potentially dangerous to the environment at large on its own. Unlike most sources of energy, where usage is not unstable and does not yield pernicious after-effects, nuclear energy falls, unfortunately, into the &#8216;extremely unstable&#8217; category. Simply building and maintaining a nuclear plant requires extreme precautions as any wrong move can potentially kill millions around the vicinity and, more severely, contaminate its surroundings, leaving millennial-long radiation effects in the area of explosion, as was with the Chernobyl nuclear catastrophe in Ukraine in 1986.</p>
<p>Nuclear technology is also exceedingly costly, especially after taking maintenance and waste disposal costs into account. Considering that nuclear technology brings with it a lot of risks, this begs the questions whether spending on this sector is even worth it. The millions of money spent on this sector could be used to develop other aspects of society, like crucial healthcare or education policies. Therefore, it would not be advisable to continue pursuing nuclear research in this aspect.</p>
<p>However, one should also take note of the merits of nuclear technology. It is able to provide endless amounts of energy in the long run. It is proven that a single uranium rock- the source of nuclear energy- can be converted to electrical energy to provide for at least a hundred households at any one time. This fact is often exploited to build nuclear reactors in strategic locations in the country in order to provide the most amount of energy to the local populace. This could greatly benefit countries such as Russia where the widely scattered distribution of population makes distributing energy very difficult and in some cases, insufficient.</p>
<p>P.s these are some arguments that students have come out with during class time. If you have any other arguments, pls comment and engage us in a fruitful discussion.</p>
